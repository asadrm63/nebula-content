// Answer the following questions in your own words
    // 1. What is a function?

    // A function is reusable code that can be used on an inputed value
    

    // 2. Why is it useful?
        
    // It's useful so we don't have to write the same code over and over and will save us time and will declutter our code

    // 3. Give a 'real world example'. Ours was woodchipper. Try and think of something yourself. 

    function car (desiredLocation){
        return newLocation
    }
        

    // 4. There is different syntax / ways of defining a function write out the syntax for each:

    //     1. Function declaration:
    function car (desiredLocation){
        return newLocation
    }
    //     2. Function expressions:
 
    const car = function(desiredLocation){
        return newLocation
    }

    //     3. Arrow functions: 
const car =(desiredLocation) => {
    return newLocation
}
    
    // 5. What is a parameter?
    // A parameter is a placeholder for an input that can when a function is made.

    // 6. What is an argument?
  
    // Arguments are the values we put in a function where the parameters were


    // 7. What does the return statement do?

    //  Return is a keyword that wil produce an output of a function, it ends function executiom and specifies the value to be returned from the function

    inconvenience
    
    

    // 8. What is scope? Do you have a real-world example of something similar to scope?
